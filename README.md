Simple exercise practice on GraphQL using ApolloGraphQl Server

### GRAPHQL PRACTICE - STAR WARS PLAYGROUND CHALLENGE

**Create a Query named GetAllPeople that will retrieve the following information:**

> Using the magic of GraphQL, We will retrieve some of the existing Connections for this [StarWars Playground](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/star-wars-swapi/variant/current/explorer)  . Let's start by fetching the "people" data from an API Playground. We'll retrieve fields like birthYear, eyeColor, gender, hairColor, homeworld (gravity, name), skinColor, species (created, designation, eyeColors), name, vehicleConnection, and vehicles (cargoCapacity, model, name, passengers, vehicleClass). This public API offers a lot of fun, and you'll see how quickly we can build a query to display the required data in our apps. Let's tackle this new challenge, Tribe!
